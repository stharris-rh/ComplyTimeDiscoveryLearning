## 📓 **Taking Notes Using GitHub Issues**

> 🎯 **Why this matters:** Taking notes in an issue will help with comfortability using Git and practicing with Markdown.

### 🧭 **Navigation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Access Issues Tab**
Navigate to the Issues tab. Click the green "New issue" box in the top right corner.

![newissuepic](../images/newissuepic.png)

#### **Step 2: Select Template**
Open an issue using the "Learning course issue template."

![issuelctemplate](../images/issuelctemplate.png)

---

### 🔧 **Update the Template Content**

#### **Step 3: Customize Your Issue**
Update the content and the `{REPLACE_ME}` areas with your Key Concepts. Click "Create" to create your issue. This will track your notes while completing Step 1: _Read the docs_.

![replaceme](../images/replaceme.png)

---

### ➡️ **Next Steps - Trigger Step 2**

> 🎯 **Action Required:** Once you have taken notes and completed the self-assessment for Step 1: Read the docs, copy the link of your issue and paste it in the comments of your Exercise: Read the docs issue.

![availableimage](../images/availableimage.png)

**Click "Comment."** That comment will trigger Step 2 to populate in the issue body.

![commenterbody](../images/commenterbody.png)

#### 💬 **Comment the Link to Populate Step 2**

![comment](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/f57b896a9898162d80e34ba6abca85fcc0da4930/steps/images/comment.png)

---

## 🚀 **Step 2: Practice Communicating Using Markdown and Git**

> 🔄 **How it works:** Comment the link to your note-taking issue on the exercise issue once finishing Step 1: _Read the Docs_. The next step will populate after around 20 seconds.

![issuecommenttrigger](../images/issuecommenttrigger.png)

### ⏳ **Populating Step 2**

![step2populate](../images/step2populate.png)

### 📋 **Follow the Directions**

![followdirections](../images/followdirections.png)

## 🌳 **Branching Workflow**

### 🏠 **Step 1: Navigate to Homepage**

> **Action:** Navigate back to the homepage to create a new branch.

![gotohome](../images/gotohome.png)

### 👀 **Step 2: View Branches**

> **Action:** Click "View All Branches." The branch `main` should be the only branch in your workspace.

![branchesviewbefore](../images/branchesviewbefore.png)

### ➕ **Step 3: Create New Branch**

> **Action:** Click the green button in the top right corner that says "New Branch."

![singlemainbranch](../images/singlemainbranch.png)

### 🏷️ **Step 4: Name Your Branch**

> **Critical:** Create a new branch named "`learn-complytime/step-2`"

> ⚠️ **Important:** This step is _crucial_ for the course to work. Ensure you create the branch name exactly as `learn-complytime/step-2`.

![learn-complytimebranchname](../images/learn-complytimebranchname.png)

Click "Create new branch." The default "Source" will be the main branch. That means that the main branch will be copied to your new `learn-complytime/step-2` branch.

> ✅ **Verify:** Make sure you are now on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch.

### 🔄 **Branch Transition**

**🔴 BEFORE:** `main` branch

![mainbranch](../images/mainbranch.png)

**🟢 AFTER:** `learn-complytime/step-2` branch

![newbranchimage](../images/newbranchimage.png)

## 📁 **Making Changes in the `markdown/` Folder**

> 🎯 **Your Task:** You will make edits to content in the Markdown folder.

Navigate to the `markdown` folder. There should be several folders `catalogs`, `profiles`, and `component-definitions`.

![markdwon](../images/markdwon.png)

### 📂 **Component Definitions Structure**

Clicking on Component Definitions there will be RHEL8, RHEL9, and RHEL10 content initialized by `complyscribe`. The folders are organized by `Example-POLICY-level/compdef-title/profile`. This example uses content for the RHEL10 ANSSI Enhanced Example Component Definition.

![try](../images/try.png)

### 📄 **Reference: RHEL10 ANSSI Control R1**

> **Reference:** Example Markdown for RHEL10 ANSSI Control R1: Hardware Support.

[Control R1 in PDF format](https://cyber.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/document/linux_configuration-en-v2.pdf)

![frompdf](../images/frompdf.png)

### 📝 **What You'll Edit**

> **Markdown version:** Control R1 from `rhel10-anssi-enhanced` OSCAL Profile.

![comdefexample](../images/comdefexample.png)

### ✏️ **How to Edit**

> **Instructions:** Updates can be made to the Component Definition editable content by clicking the pencil in the top right corner of the `r1.md` file. This is where you must make sure that the branch selected in the top left corner is `learn-complytime/step-2`.

![fixed](../images/fixed.png)

> 🧠 **Knowledge Check:** This is the step where your knowledge from the Intro to GitHub Skills and Communicate Using Markdown will be important. The "Edit" and "Preview" tabs in the GitHub UI editor will help you check your Markdown work as you go. "Edit" is the Markdown formatted text. "Preview" is the styled format with Markdown applied.

### 📝 **Editing Interface**

#### ✏️ **EDIT Mode**
> Markdown format that includes my change "Example control implementation description for control r1. This should be edited as part of Step 2 of the ComplyTime GitHub Skills Discovery."

![previewtesting](../images/previewtesting.png)

#### 👁️ **PREVIEW Mode**
> Styled Markdown format that includes my change "Example control implementation description for control r1. This should be edited as part of Step 2 of the ComplyTime GitHub Skills Discovery."

![fixeditup](../images/fixeditup.png)

## 🔄 **Git Workflow**

After making a few edits click the green button in the top right corner "Commit Changes." There will be a pop-up window that includes a field for your commit message and the extended description. The description can be left blank or expand on the changes you made to the Markdown.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Ensure the "Commit directly to the learn-complytime/step-2 branch" option is selected.

![primage](../images/primage.png)

### 📤 **Create Pull Request**

Click the green box that says "Commit Changes." Then, click **Code** in the top left corner to go back to the homepage of your repository. There will be a yellow banner that notifies you that your `learn-complytime/step-2` branch had recent pushes. Click the green box "Compare & pull request."

![PRalert](../images/PRalert.png)

### 🔍 **Compare Changes**

Once you click "Compare & pull request" there will be a new screen populated to create your pull request. Ensure that the gray banner indicates `base: main` and `compare: learn-complytime/step-2` for the pull request. This will compare your change to R1: Hardware Support that you made on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch to the `main` branch which was prior to editing the `r1.md` control implementation.

![prcompare](../images/prcompare.png)

### 📝 **Format Description**

The same rules apply for the Add a description box of the Pull Request. The "Write" tab will show the Markdown format. The "Preview" tab shows the styled Markdown format.

![PRformatted](../images/PRformatted.png)

---

## 📝 **Providing Context Through Markdown**

Update the description with the issue that you opened for taking notes on the course content. Easily link the issue by using the `#` symbol. The Pull Request has a template so you can easily use bullet points, check boxes, and link references in Markdown.

Click the green "Create pull request" button. This will create a pull request that proposes changes to the `main` branch. Your commit(s) will be shown in the pull request history.

![createprbutton](../images/createprbutton.png)

## ✅ **Checking Your Work**

### 🎯 **Result**

![hwoitlooks](../images/hwoitlooks.png)

### 📊 **Review Commits**
