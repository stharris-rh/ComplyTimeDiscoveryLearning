# sys-1.3.a16 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Additional Prevention Of Further Intrusion When Vulnerabilities Are Exploited

## Control Statement

(1) The use of system calls SHOULD be limited to those absolutely necessary, particularly for
exposed services and applications. (2) The standard profiles and/or rules (e.g. of SELinux or
AppArmor) SHOULD be checked manually and, if necessary, adapted to an organisation's own
security policies. (3) If necessary, new rules and profiles SHOULD be drawn up.
