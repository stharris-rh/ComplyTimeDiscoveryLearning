# sys-1.1.a12 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Planning The Use Of Servers

## Control Statement

Each server system SHOULD be suitably planned. In this process, the following points
SHOULD be taken into account at minimum:
• Selection of the hardware platform, operating system, and application software
• Hardware capacity (performance, memory, bandwidth, etc)
• Type and number of communication interfaces
• Power consumption, thermal load, space requirements, and structural shape
• Administrative access points (see SYS.1.1.A5 Protection of Administration Interfaces)
• User access
• Logging (see SYS.1.1.A10 Logging).
• Updates for operating systems and applications
• Integration into system and network management, backups, and protection systems
(virus protection, IDS, etc)
All decisions taken in the planning phase SHOULD be documented in such a way that they can
be understood at any future point in time.
