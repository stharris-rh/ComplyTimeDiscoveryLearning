# r36 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Changing The Default Value Of Umask

## Control Statement

The default value of UMASK for the shells must be set to 0077 in order to allow read and write access to its owner only. This value can be defined in the configuration file /etc/profile that most shells (bash, dash, ksh…) will use. The default value of UMASK for services must be determined for each service, but in most cases, it should be set to 0027 (or more restrictive). This allows read access to its owner and its group, and a full access to its owner. For services such as systemd, this value can be defined directly in the configuration file of the service with the directive UMask=0027.
