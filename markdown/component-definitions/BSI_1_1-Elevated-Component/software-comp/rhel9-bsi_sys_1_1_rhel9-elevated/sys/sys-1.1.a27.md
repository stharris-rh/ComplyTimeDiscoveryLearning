# sys-1.1.a27 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Host-Based Attack Detection

## Control Statement

(1) Host-based attack detection systems (also referred to as host-based intrusion detection
systems, IDS, or intrusion prevention systems, IPS) SHOULD be used to monitor system
behaviour for abnormalities and misuse. (2) The IDS/IPS mechanisms used SHOULD be
appropriately selected, configured, and thoroughly tested. (3) If an attack has been detected,
the operating personnel SHOULD be alerted in an appropriate manner.
(4) Using operating system mechanisms or suitable additional products, changes made to system
files and configuration settings SHOULD be checked, restricted, and reported.
