# sys-1.1.a28 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Increasing Availability Through Redundancy

## Control Statement

(1) Server systems with high availability requirements SHOULD be protected adequately against
failures. (2) At minimum, suitable redundancies SHOULD be available and maintenance contracts
concluded with the respective suppliers. (3) Whether high-availability architectures with
automatic failover (across various sites, if necessary) are required in the case of very high
requirements SHOULD be checked.
