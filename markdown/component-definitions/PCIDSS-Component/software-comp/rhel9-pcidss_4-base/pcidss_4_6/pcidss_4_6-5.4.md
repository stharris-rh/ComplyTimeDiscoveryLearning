# pcidss_4_6-5.4 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Roles And Functions Are Separated Between Production And Pre-Production Environments To Provide Accountability Such That Only Reviewed And Approved Changes Are Deployed.

## Control Statement

Job roles and accountability that differentiate between pre-production and production
activities are defined and managed to minimize the risk of unauthorized, unintentional,
or inappropriate actions. In environments with limited personnel where individuals perform
multiple roles or functions, this same goal can be achieved with additional procedural
controls that provide accountability. For example, a developer may also be an administrator
that uses an administrator-level account with elevated privileges in the development
environment and, for their developer role, they use a separate account with user-level
access to the production environment.
