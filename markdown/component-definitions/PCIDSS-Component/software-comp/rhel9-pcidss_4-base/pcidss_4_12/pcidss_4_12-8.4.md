# pcidss_4_12-8.4 - \[REPLACE_ME\] A Program Is Implemented To Monitor Tpsps' Pci Dss Compliance Status At Least Once Every 12 Months.

## Control Statement

The PCI DSS compliance status of TPSPs is verified periodically. Where an entity has an
agreement with a TPSP for meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the entity (for
example, via a firewall service), the entity must work with the TPSP to make sure the
applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If the TPSP does not meet those applicable
PCI DSS requirements, then those requirements are also "not in place" for the entity.
