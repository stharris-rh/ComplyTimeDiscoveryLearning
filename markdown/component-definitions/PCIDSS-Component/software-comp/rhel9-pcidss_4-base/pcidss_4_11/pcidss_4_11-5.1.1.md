# pcidss_4_11-5.1.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Additional Requirement For Service Providers Only: Intrusion-Detection And/Or Intrusion-Prevention Techniques Detect, Alert On/Prevent, And Address Covert Malware Communication Channels.

## Control Statement

Mechanisms are in place to detect and alert/prevent covert communications with
command-and-control systems. Alerts generated by these mechanisms are responded to by
personnel, or by automated means that ensure that such communications are blocked. This
requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. This
requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and
must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
