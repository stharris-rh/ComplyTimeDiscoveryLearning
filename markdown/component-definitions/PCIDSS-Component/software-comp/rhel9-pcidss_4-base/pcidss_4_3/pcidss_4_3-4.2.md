# pcidss_4_3-4.2 - \[REPLACE_ME\] When Using Remote-Access Technologies, Technical Controls Prevent Copy And/Or Relocation Of Pan For All Personnel, Except For Those With Documented, Explicit Authorization And A Legitimate, Defined Business Need.

## Control Statement

PAN cannot be copied or relocated by unauthorized personnel using remote-access
technologies. Storing or relocating PAN onto local hard drives, removable electronic
media, and other storage devices brings these devices into scope for PCI DSS.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required
and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
