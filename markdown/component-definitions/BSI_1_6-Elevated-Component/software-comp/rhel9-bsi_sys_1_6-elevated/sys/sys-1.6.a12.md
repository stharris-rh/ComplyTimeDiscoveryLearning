# sys-1.6.a12 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Distribution Of Secure Images

## Control Statement

(1) The sources of images that have been classified as trusted and SHOULD be adequately documented along with the corresponding reasons. (2) In addition, the process of how images or the software components contained in an image are obtained from trusted sources and eventually deployed to a productive environment SHOULD be adequately documented. (3) Images used SHOULD have metadata that makes their function and history traceable. (4) Digital signatures SHOULD secure each image against modification.
