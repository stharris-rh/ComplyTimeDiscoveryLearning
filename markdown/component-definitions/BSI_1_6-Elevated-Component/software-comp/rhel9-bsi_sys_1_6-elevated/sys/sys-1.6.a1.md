# sys-1.6.a1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Planning Container Use

## Control Statement

(1) Before containers are deployed, the goal of such a deployment (e.g. scaling, availability, disposable containers for safety or CI/CD) SHOULD be determined so that all the security- related aspects of installation, operation, and decommissioning can be planned. (2) The planning SHOULD also take into account the operational overhead resulting from container deployment or mixed operation. (3) The planning MUST be adequately documented
