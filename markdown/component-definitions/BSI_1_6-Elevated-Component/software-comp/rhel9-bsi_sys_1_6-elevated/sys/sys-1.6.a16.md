# sys-1.6.a16 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Administrative Remote Access To Containers

## Control Statement

(1)In principle, administrative access from a container to the container host and vice versa SHOULD be considered as administrative remote access. (2) Remote administrative access SHOULD NOT be established from a container to the container host. (3) Application containers SHOULD NOT contain remote maintenance access points. (4) Administrative access to application containers SHOULD always be carried out via the container runtime.
