# sys-1.6.a14 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Updating Images

## Control Statement

(1)When establishing a concept for patch and change management according to OPS.1.1.3 Patch and Change Management, it SHOULD be decided when and how the updates of images or the software or service operated are to be rolled out. (2)For persistent containers, checks SHOULD be made as to whether an update of a container is more appropriate than completely re- provisioning the container in exceptional cases.
