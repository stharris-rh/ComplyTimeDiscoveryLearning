# r36 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Changing The Default Value Of Umask

## Control Statement

The default value of UMASK for the shells must be set to 0077 in order to allow read and write access to its owner only. This value can be defined in the configuration file /etc/profile that most shells (bash, dash, kshâ€¦) will use. The default value of UMASK for services must be determined for each service, but in most cases, it should be set to 0027 (or more restrictive). This allows read access to its owner and its group, and a full access to its owner. For services such as systemd, this value can be defined directly in the configuration file of the service with the directive UMask=0027.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
