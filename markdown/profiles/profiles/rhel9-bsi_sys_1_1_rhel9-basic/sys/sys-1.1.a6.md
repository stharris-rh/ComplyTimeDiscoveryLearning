# sys-1.1.a6 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Disabling Unnecessary Services

## Control Statement

(1) All unnecessary services and applications — particularly network services — MUST be
disabled or uninstalled. (2) All unused functions in firmware MUST also be disabled.
(3) On servers, the disk space allotted to both individual users and applications SHOULD be
restricted appropriately.
(4) The decisions taken in this regard SHOULD be documented in a way that makes it clear which
configuration and software equipment was chosen for servers.
