# sys-1.6.a5 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Separation Of Administration And Access Networks For Containers

## Control Statement

(1) Networks for the administration of the host, the administration of the containers, and their access networks MUST be separated according to the protection needs at hand. (2) In principle, at least the administration of the host SHOULD only be possible from the administration network. (3) Only the communication relationships necessary for operation SHOULD be allowed.
