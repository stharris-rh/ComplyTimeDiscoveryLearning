# pcidss_4_12-7.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Potential Personnel Who Will Have Access To The Cde Are Screened, Within The Constraints Of Local Laws, Prior To Hire To Minimize The Risk Of Attacks From Internal Sources.

## Control Statement

managed. For those potential personnel to be hired for positions such as store cashiers,
who only have access to one card number at a time when facilitating a transaction, this
requirement is a recommendation only.
