# pcidss_4_6-5.4 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Roles And Functions Are Separated Between Production And Pre-Production Environments To Provide Accountability Such That Only Reviewed And Approved Changes Are Deployed.

## Control Statement

Job roles and accountability that differentiate between pre-production and production
activities are defined and managed to minimize the risk of unauthorized, unintentional,
or inappropriate actions. In environments with limited personnel where individuals perform
multiple roles or functions, this same goal can be achieved with additional procedural
controls that provide accountability. For example, a developer may also be an administrator
that uses an administrator-level account with elevated privileges in the development
environment and, for their developer role, they use a separate account with user-level
access to the production environment.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
