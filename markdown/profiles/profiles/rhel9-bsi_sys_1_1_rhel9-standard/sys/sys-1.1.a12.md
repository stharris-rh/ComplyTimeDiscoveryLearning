# sys-1.1.a12 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Planning The Use Of Servers

## Control Statement

Each server system SHOULD be suitably planned. In this process, the following points
SHOULD be taken into account at minimum:
• Selection of the hardware platform, operating system, and application software
• Hardware capacity (performance, memory, bandwidth, etc)
• Type and number of communication interfaces
• Power consumption, thermal load, space requirements, and structural shape
• Administrative access points (see SYS.1.1.A5 Protection of Administration Interfaces)
• User access
• Logging (see SYS.1.1.A10 Logging).
• Updates for operating systems and applications
• Integration into system and network management, backups, and protection systems
(virus protection, IDS, etc)
All decisions taken in the planning phase SHOULD be documented in such a way that they can
be understood at any future point in time.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
