# pcidss_4_12-8.4 - \[REPLACE_ME\] A Program Is Implemented To Monitor Tpsps' Pci Dss Compliance Status At Least Once Every 12 Months.

## Control Statement

The PCI DSS compliance status of TPSPs is verified periodically. Where an entity has an
agreement with a TPSP for meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the entity (for
example, via a firewall service), the entity must work with the TPSP to make sure the
applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If the TPSP does not meet those applicable
PCI DSS requirements, then those requirements are also "not in place" for the entity.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
