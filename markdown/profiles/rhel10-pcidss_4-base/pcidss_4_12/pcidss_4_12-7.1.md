# pcidss_4_12-7.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Potential Personnel Who Will Have Access To The Cde Are Screened, Within The Constraints Of Local Laws, Prior To Hire To Minimize The Risk Of Attacks From Internal Sources.

managed. For those potential personnel to be hired for positions such as store cashiers,
who only have access to one card number at a time when facilitating a transaction, this
requirement is a recommendation only.
