# pcidss_4_8-2.8 - \[REPLACE_ME\] If A User Session Has Been Idle For More Than 15 Minutes, The User Is Required To Re-Authenticate To Re-Activate The Terminal Or Session.

## Control Statement

A user session cannot be used except by the authorized user. This requirement is not
intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one
card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by cashiers on
point-of-sale terminals). This requirement is not meant to prevent legitimate activities
from being performed while the console/PC is unattended.
