# pcidss_4_8-3.9 - \[REPLACE_ME\] If Passwords/Passphrases Are Used As The Only Authentication Factor For User Access (I.E., In Any Single-Factor Authentication Implementation) They Should Have A Limited Lifetime.

## Control Statement

If passwords/passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for user access (i.e.,
in any single-factor authentication implementation) then either:
- Passwords/passphrases are changed at least once every 90 days,
OR
- The security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to
resources is automatically determined accordingly.
