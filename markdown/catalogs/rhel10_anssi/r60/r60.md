# r60 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Hardened Package Repositories

## Control Statement

When the distribution provides several types of repositories, preference should be given to those containing packages subject to additional hardening measures. Between two packages providing the same service, those subject to hardening (at compilation, installation, or default configuration) must be preferred.
