# a1-1.4 - \[REPLACE_ME\] The Effectiveness Of Logical Separation Controls Used To Separate Customer Environments Is Confirmed At Least Once Every Six Months Via Penetration Testing.

## Control Statement

Segmentation of customer environments from other environments is periodically validated to
be effective. The testing of adequate separation between customers in a multi-tenant
service provider environment is in addition to the penetration tests specified in
Requirement 11.4.6. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which
it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
