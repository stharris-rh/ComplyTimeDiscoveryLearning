# pcidss_4_5-4.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Processes And Automated Mechanisms Are In Place To Detect And Protect Personnel Against Phishing Attacks.

## Control Statement

Mechanisms are in place to protect against and mitigate risk posed by phishing attacks.
The focus of this requirement is on protecting personnel with access to system components
in-scope for PCI DSS. Meeting this requirement for technical and automated controls to
detect and protect personnel against phishing is not the same as Requirement 12.6.3.1 for
security awareness training. Meeting this requirement does not also meet the requirement
for providing personnel with security awareness training, and vice versa. This requirement
is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully
considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
