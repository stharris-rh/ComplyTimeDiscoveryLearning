# r77 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Protection Of The Seals Database

## Control Statement

The sealing database must be protected from malicious access by cryptographic signature mechanisms (with the key used for the signature not locally stored in clear), or possibly stored on a separate machine of the one on which the sealing is done. Check section "Database and config signing in AIDE manual" https://aide.github.io/doc/#signing
