# sys-1.3.a8 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Encrypted Access Via Secure Shell

## Control Statement

(1) Only Secure Shell (SSH) SHOULD be used to create an encrypted and authenticated interactive
connection between two IT systems. (2) All other protocols whose functions are covered by
Secure Shell SHOULD be disabled completely. (3) For authentication, users SHOULD primarily
use certificates instead of passwords.
