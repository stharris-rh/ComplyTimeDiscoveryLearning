still be present on the storage media is lost and no sensitive data remains.
(2) There SHOULD be an overview of the data stored in each location on the server.
(3) Furthermore, it SHOULD be ensured that services offered by the server will be taken over
by another server when necessary.
(4) A checklist SHOULD be created that is to be completed when decommissioning a server.
(5) This checklist SHOULD at least include aspects related to backing up data, migrating
services, and subsequently deleting all data in a secure manner.
