# pcidss_4_3-7.6 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Where Manual Cleartext Cryptographic Key-Management Operations Are Performed By Personnel, Key-Management Policies And Procedures Are Implemented Include Managing These Operations Using Split Knowledge And Dual Control.

## Control Statement

Cleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by anyone. Operations involving cleartext
keys cannot be carried out by a single person. This control is applicable for manual
key-management operations or where key management is not controlled by the encryption

generated via one of the following
