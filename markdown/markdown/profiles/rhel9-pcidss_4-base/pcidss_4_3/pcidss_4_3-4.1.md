# pcidss_4_3-4.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Pan Is Masked When Displayed (The Bin And Last Four Digits Are The Maximum Number Of Digits To Be Displayed), Such That Only Personnel With A Legitimate Business Need Can See More Than The Bin And Last Four Digits Of The Pan.

## Control Statement

PAN displays are restricted to the minimum number of digits necessary to meet a defined
business need. This requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for
displays of cardholder data â€” for example, legal or payment brand requirements for
point-of-sale (POS) receipts. This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is
displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with
Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, or transmitted.
