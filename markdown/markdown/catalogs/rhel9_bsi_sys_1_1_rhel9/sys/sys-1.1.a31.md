# sys-1.1.a31 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Using Execution Control

## Control Statement

(1) Execution control SHOULD be used to ensure that only explicitly authorised programs and
scripts can be executed. (2) The rules SHOULD be set as restrictively as possible. (3) If explicit
specification of paths and hashes is not possible, certificate-based or path rules SHOULD be
used as an alternative.
