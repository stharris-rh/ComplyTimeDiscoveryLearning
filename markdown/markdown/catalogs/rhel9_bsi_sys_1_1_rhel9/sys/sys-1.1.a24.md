# sys-1.1.a24 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Security Checks For Servers

## Control Statement

(1) Servers SHOULD be subjected to regular security tests to check their compliance with the
applicable security requirements and identify possible vulnerabilities. (2) In particular,
these security tests SHOULD be performed on servers with external interfaces. (3) To prevent
indirect attacks via infected systems in an organisation’s own network, internal server
systems SHOULD also be checked accordingly at defined intervals. (4) Whether the security
checks can be realised automatically—by means of suitable scripts, for example—SHOULD be
examined.
