# sys-1.1.a33 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Active Administration Of Root Certificates

## Control Statement

(1) As part of the procurement and installation of a server, the root certificates that are
required to operate the server SHOULD be documented. (2) Only the previously documented root
certificates required for operation SHOULD be present on the server. (3) Regular checks SHOULD
be performed as to whether existing root certificates still comply with the respective
organisationâ€™s requirements. (4) All certificate stores on the IT system at hand SHOULD be
included in these checks.
