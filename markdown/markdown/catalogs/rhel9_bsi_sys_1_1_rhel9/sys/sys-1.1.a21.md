# sys-1.1.a21 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Operational Documentation For Servers

## Control Statement

(1) Operational tasks that are carried out on a server SHOULD be clearly documented in terms
of what has been done, when, and by whom. (2) In particular, the documentation SHOULD make
configuration changes transparent. (3) Security-relevant responsibilities, such as who is
authorised to install new hard disks, SHOULD be documented. (4) Everything that can be
documented automatically SHOULD be documented automatically. (5) The documentation SHOULD be
protected against unauthorised access and loss.
