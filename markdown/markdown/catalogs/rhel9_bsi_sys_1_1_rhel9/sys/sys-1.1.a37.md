# sys-1.1.a37 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Encapsulation Of Security-Critical Applications And Operating System Components

## Control Statement

(1) In order to prevent an attacker from accessing the operating system or other applications and
prevent access from the operating system to files that are particularly sensitive, applications
and operating system components (such as authentication or certificate verification) SHOULD
be specially encapsulated according to their protection needs or isolated from other
applications and operating system components. (2) Particular attention SHOULD be paid to
security-critical applications that work with data from insecure sources (e.g. web browsers and
office communication applications)
