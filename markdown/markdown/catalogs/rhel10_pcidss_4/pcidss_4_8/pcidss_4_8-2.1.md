# pcidss_4_8-2.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] All Users Are Assigned A Unique Id Before Access To System Components Or Cardholder Data Is Allowed.

## Control Statement

All actions by all users are attributable to an individual. This requirement is not
intended to apply to user accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have access to only
one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by cashiers
on point-of-sale terminals).
