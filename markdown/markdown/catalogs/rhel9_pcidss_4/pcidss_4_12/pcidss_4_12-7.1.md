# pcidss_4_12-7.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Potential Personnel Who Will Have Access To The Cde Are Screened, Within The Constraints Of Local Laws, Prior To Hire To Minimize The Risk Of Attacks From Internal Sources.

## Control Statement

The risk related to allowing new members of staff access to the CDE is understood and
managed. For those potential personnel to be hired for positions such as store cashiers,
who only have access to one card number at a time when facilitating a transaction, this
requirement is a recommendation only.
