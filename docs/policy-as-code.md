# **📜 Policy as Code: Automating Your Rules**

Policy as Code (PaC) is about **defining, updating, sharing, and enforcing policies using code.** It transforms abstract rules into executable instructions, making compliance and security more efficient.

## **🎯 Our Goals for Policy as Code**

We aim to seamlessly integrate compliance frameworks with policy engines, enabling the use of diverse tools for compliance checks.

* **Flexibility:** Choose your preferred policy engines and compliance frameworks.  
* **Community-Driven:** Foster plugin extensions for broad support.

### **🛠️ The Core Idea: Policy as a Rule**

At its heart, a policy is a rule or guideline governing operations to achieve compliance, standards, or consistency.

* **Shift from Discussion to Evidence:** Less talk about compliance measures, more machine-readable evidence of adherence.  
* **Example:** Automated testing scripts that verify your defined policies are correctly enforced.

### **⚙️ Policy Engines: Enforcing the Rules**

Policy engines are the tools that enforce these code-defined policies.

* **Kyverno:** 🛡️ A powerful policy engine for Kubernetes resources.

* **Auditree:** 🌳 A GitOps tool for evidence collection and verification, especially for cloud services via APIs.

### **🌉 Bridging Compliance & Policy: The C2P Project**

The compliance-to-policy projects (also known as C2P) are designed to bridge the gap between **Compliance as Code** and **Policy as Code**.

Compliance As Code \= 📝 OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)  
Policy As Code \= 🎯 Used by Policy Validation Points (PVP)

Here's how C2P works in a typical pipeline:

1. **C2P Execution:** Runs in GitOps pipelines, Kubernetes controllers, or Python/Go environments.  
2. **Input:** Receives **Compliance as Code** (e.g., an OSCAL Component Definition) — mapping controls to policies by name/ID.  
3. **Policy Generation:** C2P uses **plugins** (one for each policy engine) to generate native policies.  
   * *Plugin Role:* Takes policy names/IDs and returns executable policies.  
4. **Policy Delivery:** Policies are deployed to the respective policy engines.  
5. **Result Collection:** Results are gathered from the policy engines.  
6. **Result Aggregation:** C2P aggregates policy engine results by controls, again using plugins.  
   * *Plugin Role:* Handles verdicts (pass/fail/error) and reasoning for each policy.  
7. **Output:** C2P produces **Compliance Assessment Results** (OSCAL Assessment Results) — showing the assessment status of each control.

**Where does C2P come into play?**

C2P generates policies in the **native format of PVPs** *from* OSCAL Component Definitions. It then produces **OSCAL Assessment Results** *from* the native assessment results of PVPs.

C2P integrates seamlessly into **Continuous Compliance pipelines** like:

* GitHub Actions 🚀  
* Tekton Pipelines 🌊  
* Agile Authoring Pipelines ✍️
