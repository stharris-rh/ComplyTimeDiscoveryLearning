## **Getting Started**

Follow the steps in the [**manual_steps.md**](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) for an in-depth walkthrough and example of editing content in the `markdown/` folder.

1. **Create a New Branch**: In your copy of the learning course, create a new branch named `learn-complytime/step-2`. 
2. **Switch Branches**: Switch to the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. This is where you'll start working with Git and Markdown.  
3. **Navigate and Review**: Go to the `markdown/` folder and review its contents. You'll find catalogs, profiles, and component definitions that were initialized by `complyscribe`.  
   * **Editing Example**: The in-depth walkthrough in the  [**manual steps**](https://github.com/complytime/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) provides an example of editing Markdown in the `markdown/component-definitions/My-Test-Component/My-Test-Component/rhel10-anssi-enhanced/r1/r1.md` file. Use this as a guide to make changes to the control implementations in the Component Definitions. **Directions are hidden until you begin editing the Markdown file.**  
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes to your `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. You can make several commits as you work.  
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Open a Pull Request and update its description to clearly explain the changes you've made in the Markdown files.  
6. **Submit Your Work**: Copy the link to your Pull Request and submit it in the self-assessment.  
7. **Keep Practicing\!**: There's no limit to how many times you can retry this exercise. Simply follow the steps in the [**manual steps**](https://github.com/complytime/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) again.
