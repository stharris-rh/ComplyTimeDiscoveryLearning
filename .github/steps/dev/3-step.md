## Step 2: Deep Dive into `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` 

_This repository houses authored OSCAL content initialized by complyscribe_


After completing the thorough review of the projects and tools in _Step 1: Read the docs_ you can strengthen your understanding by example.

## Mapping `oscal-content-demo` to the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content`

### Bidirectional Synchronization
Stay updated wth content changes where `sync-oscal-cac` and `sync-cac-oscal` make sure that the _back and forth_ exchange of information is accurate. 

#### `sync-oscal-cac` 

Once there is a change made in the `oscal-content` repository, there is an automatic trigger that transforms the `ComplianceAsCode/content` content and requests a change to that material. 

_Goal: updates should be synchronized and accurate_

    A[OSCAL Content PR #33] --> B[Workflow Triggered]
    B --> C[Content Transformation]
    C --> D[ComplianceAsCode PR #13617]
```

Above, the PR in the `oscal-content` will trigger the workflow and make sure the changes are initialized by `complyscribe` and sending that back to the `ComplianceAsCode/content` repository.

The updates automatically trigger the request to propose changes to the `ComplianceAsCode/content` repository content. The deletion of rules from the `component-definition.json` trigger the automatic generation of this [PR](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/pull/13680) in `ComplianceAsCode/content`. The PR proposes changes to the levels applied to te control file [cis_rhel8](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/pull/13680/files#diff-c97f4c1b44844a9d76570cbbc2bf8fdbceb1dc1076461fc8408870ab612cad9cR33) in `ComplianceAsCode/content`

#### `sync-cac-oscal`

Once there is a change in the `ComplianceAsCode/content` content, there is an automatic trigger that will transform the content that `complyscribe` handles and then requests for that transformed change to be placed back in the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` repository.

Above, the control file defines the RHEL8 HIPAA profile. The change makes it simpler to reference this [hipaa control file](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/controls/hipaa.yml) in the [RHEL8 HIPAA Profile](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/products/rhel8/profiles/hipaa.profile). The rules associated with the controls are now in the control file and referenced in the RHEL8 Profile. The table below outlines the Rule, `ComplianceAsCode/content` representation, and the PDF reference to the requirement that the rule satisfies.

## Perspective :book::custard:

Think of the relationship of `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` and `ComplianceAsCode/content` repository with this analogy.

**Imagine you have the original first-edition cookbook for all things pastries** :custard: :cookie:. 

- Let's call this book _The Original Project Bakeshop_, containing the foundational recipes for every pastry and treat from cupcakes, to NATA, to creme-brulee. It's the source of truth for all baking endeavors. 

**Now, you have a good friend, your baking confidant, who wants to specialize in the creme-brulee :custard: recipe section of _The Original Project Bakeshop_.**

- They want to have their own specialized version of your cookbook that builds on the results, but makes sure any recipe changes made in the first-edition are factored into their copy. 
- This version focuses only on creme-brulee, but i's based on the recipes available in _The Original Project Bakeshop_.

As you both bake, you'll tweak :magic_wand: a few things here and there. Potentially finding a better way to infuse vanilla or a better torching :fire: technique that creates an immaculate crispy top. You both want the recipe to be the best that it can be, and that means ensuring both the first-edition creme-brulee section and the creme-brulee dedicated book reflect the newfound methods. 

**GitHub Actions:** Culinary Coordinators :cook::magic_wand::bellhop_bell:

GitHub Actions is your incredibly efficient team of culinary coordinators. Their sole purpose is to ensure that any improvements made to the creme-brulee recipe in _The Original Project Bakeshop_ or the specialized creme-brulee book are perfectly synchronized, resulting in the best creme-brulee that is approved by the first-edition.

#### Here's how it works:

- Your update to the creme-brulee recipe of _The Original Project Bakeshop_ you're telling your culinary coordinators "Hey, I just made an improvement to creme-brulee! Everyone needs to know about this!"
- Your friend updates the specialized recipe discovering an even more efficient way to caramelize sugar with the torching method. They also reach out to the culinary coordinators.
- The coordinators get to work and compare the recipe books. If _The Original Project Bakeshop_ was updated, they make sure the improvement is reflected in your friend's specialized creme-brulee book :arrows_clockwise:. If the specialized book has a brilliant new discovery, the coordinators ensure that is exchanged and shared back to keep _The Original Project Bakeshop_ up-to-date. 
- The constant, automated synchronization keeps you and your friend working from the most refined and complete creme-brulee instructions. 

GitHub Actions act as the automated bridge to ensure specific, related recipe changes are synchronized for consistent final products.
