# Step 2: Practice Communicating using Markdown and Git

> You should've completed the _Communicate Using Markdown_ GitHub Skills course as a pre-requisite. 

## What you'll need

After completing [**Step 1:** _Read the docs_](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/.github/steps/1-step.md) you'll need to copy the link to the exercise issue and include it in the Pull request.

Follow the [help guide](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/docs/issue-help.md) for creating issues.

## **Getting Started**

Follow the steps in the [manual_steps.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) for an in-depth walkthrough and example of editing content in the `markdown/` folder.

1. **Create a New Branch**: In your copy of the learning course, create a new branch named `learn-complytime/step-2`. 
2. **Switch Branches**: Switch to the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. This is where you'll start working with Git and Markdown.  
3. **Navigate and Review**: Go to the `markdown/` folder and review its contents. You'll find catalogs, profiles, and component definitions that were initialized by `complyscribe`.  
   * **Editing Example**: The in-depth walkthrough in the [course_layout.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/course_layout.md) provides an example of editing Markdown in the `markdown/profiles/rhel10-anssi-enhanced/r1/r1.md` file. Use this as a guide to make changes in the "Editable Content" section of your control files. **Directions are hidden until you begin editing the Markdown file.**  
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes to your `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. You can make several commits as you work.  
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Open a Pull Request and update its description to clearly explain the changes you've made in the Markdown files.  
6. **Submit Your Work**: Copy the link to your Pull Request and submit it in the self-assessment.  
7. **Keep Practicing\!**: There's no limit to how many times you can retry this exercise. Simply follow the steps in the [**manual steps**](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) again. For additional help, refer to the [**course layout**](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/course_layout.md).

# r12 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Ipv4 Configuration Options

## Control Statement

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
