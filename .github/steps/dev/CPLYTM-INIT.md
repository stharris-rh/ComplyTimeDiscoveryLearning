## Step 3: Initialize a complytime workspace (WIP)

_You'll generate assessment plans_

### üìñ Theory: Leverage authored OSCAL Content from your [trestle-workspace](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/trestle-workspace/tree/main) to generate an assessment-plan.

Checkout the complytime repository [here](https://github.com/complytime/complytime)

- Potentially create another public template repository that has content from the trestle-workspace and associated ansible playbooks to load with complytime-demos.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Use ComplyTime to generate an assessment-plan.json

After following the steps in `1-step.md` and creating some OSCAL Content, you can begin using complytime.

- Vagrant sandbox will be here 
- Developers can clone their trestle-workspace in the vagrant environment and load the files into complytime for assessment-plan generation
